# Episode 6 ‚Äì UI, Pellet Collection & Power-Ups

In this episode, we bring more interactivity and polish to the game by adding a user interface and implementing pellet collection.

We draw a UI area on the screen, display the score and lives, and update them in real time as the game progresses.

### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs covered:
- Creating a UI area at the top of the screen.
- Displaying and updating the player‚Äôs score and lives using Turtle Graphics.
- Detecting collisions between Pac-Man and pellets.
- Removing pellets from the screen when eaten.
- Awarding points for regular pellets and power pellets.
- Adding a temporary speed boost effect when Pac-Man eats a power pellet.

By the end of this episode, the game feels more alive ‚Äî with a working score system, a visual HUD, and satisfying pellet collection mechanics.
