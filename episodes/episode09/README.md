# Episode 9 – Custom Shapes & Game Audio

In this final episode, we add the finishing touches that make the game feel complete — visuals and sound effects!

We replace the default shapes with custom images and add game audio to enhance the player experience.

### 🛠️ What’s covered:
- Loading and registering custom shapes for Pac-Man and enemies
- Updating the player and enemy appearances using image assets
- Adding sound effects for:
  - Game start

By the end of this episode, the game not only plays well — it *looks* and *sounds* like a real arcade experience. Congratulations on completing the full Pac-Man in Python series!
