# Episode 1 ‚Äì Project Setup & Game Structure

In this episode, we begin building our Pac-Man clone using Python and Turtle Graphics.

We set up the basic project structure and write the initial code that will drive the rest of the game.

### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs covered:
- Creating the main `main.py` file
- Setting up the Turtle screen (size, title, background color)
- Defining the `main()` function to initialize the game
- Creating the `game_loop()` function to handle real-time updates
- Structuring the program to support modular development in future episodes

By the end of this episode, we have a working game window and a clear game structure ‚Äî with a loop that will drive all updates going forward.
