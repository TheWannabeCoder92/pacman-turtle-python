# Episodes 2 & 3 ‚Äì Grid Setup & Maze Drawing

In these episodes, we focus on designing and rendering the game maze that Pac-Man will navigate through.

We break the maze into a grid-based system and build the core components that define and draw it on screen.

### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs covered:
- Defining the maze layout using a grid structure
- Creating `constants.py` to store game constants like cell size, screen size, and tile characters
- Creating `mazes.py` to hold the maze layout and a function to convert it into drawable coordinates
- Creating `renderer.py` to draw the maze based on wall positions
- Using Turtle Graphics to render the maze in the game window

By the end of these episodes, we have a functional grid-based maze rendered in the game window ‚Äî ready for Pac-Man and other game elements to interact with.
