# Episode 5 ‚Äì Wall Collisions & Turn Corrections

In this episode, we improve the player movement by adding logic to handle wall collisions and smoother turns.

We ensure Pac-Man can‚Äôt walk through walls, and we refine the movement system so he can turn accurately at corners.

### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs covered:
- Implementing wall collision detection for the player
- Checking directional edges of the player's position against maze wall coordinates
- Preventing movement into walls by blocking directions
- Adding turn correction logic to allow cleaner corner turns

By the end of this episode, Pac-Man respects the maze walls and moves more smoothly, resulting in more responsive and accurate controls.
