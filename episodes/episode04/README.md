# Episode 4 ‚Äì Player Setup & Movement

In this episode, we add Pac-Man to the game and give him the ability to move around the maze.

We create a new file called `actors.py`, where we define the player‚Äôs behavior and appearance.

### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs covered:
- Creating the `actors.py` file
- Defining the `Player` class to represent Pac-Man
- Drawing the player on screen using Turtle Graphics
- Implementing basic movement logic for the player
- Binding arrow keys to allow real-time control of Pac-Man

By the end of this episode, Pac-Man is fully visible on screen and can move through the maze using the keyboard.
