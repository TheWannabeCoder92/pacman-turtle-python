# Pac-Man in Python 🐍🎮

This is a beginner-friendly Pac-Man clone built using Python's Turtle Graphics module.

The code is part of a full YouTube tutorial series, where we build the game step by step — covering everything from drawing the maze to player movement, collision logic, and more.

## 🐍 Requirements

No external libraries needed – just Python 3.x.

Make sure `turtle` is available (it's included with standard Python installs).

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
